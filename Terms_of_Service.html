    <h1>Terms of Service - HSA Monster</h1>
    
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: January 15, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using the HSA Monster mobile application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. About the App</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>HSA Monster is a Health Savings Account (HSA) expense tracking application ("we," "us," or "our") that helps users track HSA transactions, manage receipts, and maintain long-term health expense records. The App stores all data, including transaction records and receipt attachments, on your device using Core Data. If you enable iCloud sync, your data is also stored in your personal iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit technology for seamless syncing across your devices and secure family sharing.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Contact Information</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <div class="contact-info">
            <p>For questions about these Terms or the App, contact us at: <strong>schultzapps@gmail.com</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>4. License to Use</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with these Terms and the Apple App Store Terms of Service.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Privacy</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <h3>5.1 Your Personal Data</h3>
        <div class="subsection">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All HSA transaction data, family member information, and receipt attachments you enter are stored on your device using Core Data. We do not store, access, or process your HSA data on our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>iCloud Sync (Optional):</strong> If you enable iCloud sync, your HSA transaction data and receipt attachments are also stored in your personal iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit. This enables seamless syncing across your devices and secure family sharing (when enabled). You can disable iCloud sync at any time, and your data will remain only on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Receipt Attachments:</strong> Receipt images and PDFs you capture or upload are stored as part of your Core Data database, either locally on your device or in CloudKit (if iCloud sync is enabled). Receipts are securely attached to their associated transactions and sync across your devices when iCloud is enabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Photos and Documents:</strong> Any receipts you capture with the camera or import from your photo library or files are accessed through Apple's standard APIs and stored in your Core Data database. We never have access to your photos, documents, or receipts.</li>
                <li><strong>On-Device AI Processing:</strong> If you use the receipt scanning feature, text recognition and data extraction are performed entirely on your device using Apple's Vision and Natural Language frameworks (or Apple Foundation Models on supported devices). No receipt data is sent to our servers or any third-party AI service.</li>
                <li><strong>iCloud Terms:</strong> Your use of iCloud storage is subject to Apple's iCloud Terms and Conditions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>5.2 Anonymous Analytics and Third-Party Services</h3>
        <div class="subsection">
            <p>The App uses the following third-party services that collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable data:</p>

                <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> To identify and fix crashes</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase Remote Config:</strong> To deliver app configuration updates</li>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> To manage in-app purchases and subscription status</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This anonymous data does not include your HSA transaction information, receipts, or family member details. For more details, see our Privacy Policy.</p>
